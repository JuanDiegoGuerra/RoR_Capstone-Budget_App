# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# purchase = Purchase.create(name: 'shirt', author: user, amount: 2)
# group = Group.create(name: 'Mcdonalds', icon: 'https://es.logodownload.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/McDonalds-logo-11.png', author: user)
# group.purchases << purchase
